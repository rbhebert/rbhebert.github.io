  <summary>“Alcohol, Pregnancy, and Health Outcomes” </summary>
  
  Abstract: Alcohol negatively impacts health outcomes at every stage of pregnancy, from conception timing to childhood development. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder alone is estimated to cost $1.29-10 billion annually in the U.S. Despite this, few public policies have been shown to affect alcohol consumption by women of reproductive age. In this study, I explore two policies endorsed by public health authorities, state-level alcohol excise taxes and laws mandating the placement of signs at the point-of-sale warning of the dangers of drinking during pregnancy. I study these policies across six data sources covering thirty years, using contemporary difference-in-difference methods. I also use a novel approach for standardizing alcohol taxes that vary across different products and in their administration. Contrary to earlier research, I find that neither policy leads to significant changes in drinking behavior or fetal health outcomes.
